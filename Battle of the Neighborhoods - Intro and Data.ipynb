Specifically, this report will be targeted to stakeholders interested in opening an **Indian restaurant** in **Howard County, MD**, USA.\n\nSince there are lots of restaurants in and around Howard County we will try to detect **locations that are not already crowded with restaurants**. We are also particularly interested in **areas with no Indian restaurants in vicinity**. We would also prefer locations **as close to county center as possible**, assuming that first two conditions are met.\n\nWe will use our data science powers to generate a few most promissing neighborhoods based on this criteria. Advantages of each area will then be clearly expressed so that best possible final location can be chosen by stakeholders."
